Usage: it3a-ds [-d] [-f] [-k<file>] [-i{l|b}{X}] [-l<hex address>] [-h<hex address>] [-j] [-m] [-n] [-p] [-r{i}] [-q] [-s] [-x] [-u] [-v] [-w] [-z] <srcfile>
where:
  -d  treat input file as memory dump (.lod file)
  -b<label>  start at label   -e<label>  end at label
  -f  print loop_end          -j do not disassemble BSS sections
  -i{l|b}{X}  use interactive mode 
	{l|b} specifies endianness of the input string 
	X can be 2|4|8|16|32|64 and represents the number of AUs
  -l<addr>  start at address  -h<addr>  end at address
  -k<file>  config file       -p  suppress Pc display
  -q  suppress banner         -s  suppress label and header display
  -u  ignore relocation information
  -v  version                 -x  display hex codification mixed with assembly
  -z  display statistics      -n  display the unmangle C++ name 
  -w  do not output local symbols when processing .eld files
  -t  do not disassemble data sections -m suppress mapper labels
  <srcfil>  assembled source file
